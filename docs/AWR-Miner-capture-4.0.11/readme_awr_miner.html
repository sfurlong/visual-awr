<h2>What is AWR Miner?</h2>

<p>This script queries the AWR repository and gathers key database metrics from
each AWR snapshot over the last n days. These metrics can assist in sizing and
tuning excercises. An AWR report provides much more detailed metrics but only
between 2 snapshots. This script and the subsequent graphs produced from its
data provide higher level aggregate data over a longer period of time.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Diagnostic Pack License Required</h2>

<p>This script queries DBA_HIST_ views in the Automatic Workload Repository
(AWR). To generate AWR reports, take AWR snapshots, or queries these views
requires a license for the Diagnostic Pack (<a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/license.121/e17614/options.htm#DBLIC165"
 target="_blank">12.1 document</a>, <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/license.112/e10594/options.htm#CIHIHDDJ"
 target="_blank">11.2 document</a> or <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/license.102/b14199/options.htm#sthref76" target="_blank">10.2
document</a>). You should NOT run this script on any Database that is not
licensed for the Diagnostic Pack .</p>

<p></p>

<h2>How to Run the Script</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run this as sys or system (or a DBA account), preferably on the
    production system(s). If the desired goal is sizing a production system,
    output from a development system is of little benefit. </li>
  <li>If this is a RAC cluster you only need to run this from 1 node as the
    DBA_HIST_ views contain data from all nodes.</li>
  <li>login.sql files found via the SQLPATH environment variable have caused problems in the past.
  To avoid these, you can optionally unset the SQLPATH shell environment variable before logging in to sqlplus: <br />
<pre>[bash] unset SQLPATH
[windows] set SQLPATH=</pre><br />
  </li>
  <li>Run from sqlplus command-line connected as a dba, not TOAD or SQL Developer:<br />
  <pre>SQL> @awr_miner</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Wait for the script to finish. It could take longer over slower network connections. The last line displayed on the screen will be 
  <strong>~~END-TOP-SQL-BY-SNAPID~~</strong>, then standard SQL prompt will return.</li>
  <li>Do NOT spool the output, it will automatically spool it to a file with a
    specific name ( awr-hist*.out ). Do not change the file name as the
	code to parse this file is looking for files with a specific pattern.</li>
  <li>Optionally compress the awr-hist*.out file using gzip or zip and
    email it back. The generated file will be anywhere from 1-30 MB and is
    highly compressable. Compressed output should be under 300 KB - 2 MB. Variables 
	that will increase the file size are longer AWR retention periods (but more 
	information is better), shorter snapshot intervals (again, more information
	is often better), and large numbers of RAC nodes.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<h2>Will This Impact My System?</h2>

<p>It should have little to no impact on your system. It generally takes less
than 45 seconds to run on anything from a laptop to an Exadata Full Rack and
incurs less load than generating 1 AWR report. All queries are serial so at
most this will occupy 1 CPU core for under a minute. Absolutely no objects are
created in the Database.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Can I View the Output?</h2>

<p>Absolutely. It's just a plain text file with stadard reports composed of
rows and columns. Ultimately this file is parsed and plotted with an R script
by someone at Oracle.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
Below are some common issues encountered in gathering this data and how to potentially avoid them.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Invalid File Names</strong> occur when the name of the .out file is changed. Do not change the file name or extension. It should be in the form:<br />
	awr-hist-dbid-dbname-snapidmin-snapidmax.out . If compressed using gzip, it should have a trailing .gz suffix.</li>
	<li><strong>Unparseable content</strong> This almost always occurs when the .out file has been edited to search and replace for schema names or host names. The file
	layout is columnar so if you replace the schema name SCOTT with XX, that will shift the columns 3 positions to the left for those rows, making it impossible to parse.</li>
	<li><strong>Truncated output</strong> has been a minor but persistent problem. The reason for this is unknown at this time, but could be due to a very slow
	connection to the server which causes longer than expected run times for the script. If possible, run the script directly from the database host. 
	Make sure to wait for the script to end. The last line will be <strong>~~END-TOP-SQL-BY-SNAPID~~</strong>. There should be 9 or more sections which you can verify with grep (the number at the end of the file name is the
	the count of sections):<br />
	<pre>grep -c "~~END" *.out
awr-hist-148658377-TWELVE1-1225-1320.out:12
awr-hist-3107787169-TENTWO-227-307.out:12
awr-hist-3107787169-TENTWO-251-330.out:12
awr-hist-3846920754-RAC81P-289-1209.out:12

	</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
